# Dog-vs-Cat--ML-1
Tensorflow model to correctly identify whether a picture is that of a cat or a dog.

At first, the model had a 49.56% accuracy. As you can see, something is wrong here.

After going up from 2 convolution layers(orange) where the accuracy remained stagnant at around ~50% to 6 convolution layers(lavender), the accuracy increased all the way up to 94.72%.

Yay. This helped a lot with the differentiation between Cat and Dog.
