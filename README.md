# Dog-vs-Cat--ML-1
Tensorflow model to correctly identify whether a picture is that of a cat or a dog. All of the testing and training picture files came from Kaggle's 'Dog vs Cat' competition.

At first, the model had a 49.08% accuracy. As you can see, something is wrong here.

After going up from 2 convolution layers(orange) where the accuracy remained stagnant at around ~50% to 6 convolution layers(lavender), the accuracy increased all the way up to 95.40%.

Now the algorithm can accurately differentiate between Cat and Dog :)
